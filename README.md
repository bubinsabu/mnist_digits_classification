Deep Learning Classification Projects

Welcome to the repository for deep learning classification projects!
This repository contains beginner-friendly projects that aim to help you learn and explore various deep learning concepts, 
particularly in the field of image classification. We use popular datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR to train and evaluate our models.
          About the Projects
The projects in this repository are designed to provide hands-on experience in building deep learning models for classification tasks. 
We focus on using well-known datasets, such as MNIST and CIFAR, to keep the projects accessible to beginners.
Each project folder contains a separate deep learning classification task. You will find a detailed README file within each project folder, 
explaining the goals, steps, and code involved in the project. The projects build on each other, gradually introducing new concepts and 
techniques as you progress.

The projects cover a range of topics, including:

Loading and preprocessing datasets
Implementing and training deep learning models
Evaluating model performance
Visualizing model predictions and results
Experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters

Feel free to explore the projects in any order, but we recommend starting from the beginning and working your way through.
This will help you grasp the foundational concepts before moving on to more advanced topics.
